This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Brief

To convert a visual mockup of a meeting scheduler to a working website. There's a home page where a list of meetings is displayed (fetched from API) and the user can use the search bar at the top to filter the list based on meeting owner's name or the meeting's title. If the user navigates to the schedule page they can schedule a new meeting, when they do so a post request will be made to the meetings API and the new meeting is displayed on the homepage.

### To run:

- Clone the repository
